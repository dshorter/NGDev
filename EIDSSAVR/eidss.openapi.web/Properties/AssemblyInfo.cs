    /// A RESTful application is an application that exposes its state and functionality as a set of resources that the clients can manipulate and conforms to a certain set of principles:<br/>
    /// • All resources are uniquely addressable, usually through URIs; other addressing can also be used, though.<br/>
    /// • All resources can be manipulated through a constrained set of well-known actions, usually CRUD (create, read, update, delete), represented most often through the HTTP's POST, GET, PUT and DELETE; it can be a different set or a subset though - for example, some implementations limit that set to read and modify only (GET and PUT) for example<br/>
    /// • The data for all resources is transferred through any of a constrained number of well-known representations, usually HTML, XML or JSON;<br/>
    /// • The communication between the client and the application is performed over a stateless protocol that allows for multiple layered intermediaries that can reroute and cache the requests and response packets transparently for the client and the application.<br/><br/>
